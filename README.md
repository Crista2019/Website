# Website
The code *(HTML/CSS, JS)* used in maintaining my website, cristafalk.com. I use this website for web devel practice and because I enjoy making websites.

# A Few Notes
* ###### I have my code categorized by language and further organized into website 'version' so to speak.
* ###### Each 'version' represents a point at which I became so deeply repulsed by my website that I started over from scratch entirely.
* ###### Rather than replacing files when they were completely rearchitected, I chose to keep them as their own files as an exercise in nostalgia vs. self-abasement. It's worked out well.

# Synopsis of my Website's History
Website1.0 | Website2.0  | Website3.0

c. 2014-2015 | c. 2016-2017 | c. 2017-present
First learning how to apply markup/scripting languages to "[real life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life)" | Trying to balance the inferiority complex of learning new languages such as Python, C++, etc with the comparable inferiority complex of designing an amatuer website (i.e. *improvement*)| Eventual choice to implement potential frameworks or APIs such as AngularJS or possibly ReactJS; any number of Google analytics or misc. APIs. To be determined.
Learning phase | Self-Aware Learning Phase | Still Learning, but Learning *Better*
