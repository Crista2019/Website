# Website
The code *(HTML/CSS, JS)* used in maintaining my website, cristafalk.com.

# A Few Notes
* I have my code categorized by language and further organized into website 'version' so to speak.
* Each 'version' represents a point at which I became so deeply repulsed by my website that I started over from scratch entirely.
* Rather than replacing files when they were completely rearchitected, I chose to keep them as their own files as an exercise in nostalgia vs. self-abasement. It's worked out well.

# Synopsis of my Website's History
Website1.0 | Website2.0  | Website3.0

c. 2014-2015 | c.2016-2017 | c.2017-present

First learning how to apply markup/scripting languages to "[real life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life)" | 
Trying to balance the inferiority complex of learning new languages such as Python, C++, etc with the comparable inferiority complex of designing an amatuer website > *improvement*| 
Eventual choice to implement potential frameworks or APIs such as AngularJS or possibly ReactJS; any number of Google analytics or misc. APIs. To be determined.
