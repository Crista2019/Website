# Website
The code *(HTML/CSS, JS)* used in maintaining my website, cristafalk.com. I use this website for web devel practice and because I enjoy making websites.

# A Few Notes
* ###### I have my code categorized by language and further organized into website 'version' so to speak.
* ###### Each 'version' represents a point at which I became so deeply repulsed by my website that I started over from scratch entirely.
* ###### Rather than replacing files when they were completely rearchitected, I chose to keep them as their own files as an exercise in nostalgia vs. self-abasement. It's worked out well.
