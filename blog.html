                                <p>To preface this post, see the image to the left. Sophomore year has been full of activity, both hectic and entirely welcome by me. I have continued to participate in varsity scholastic team (i.e. brain/quiz bowl), volunteering at the library (serving on the teen advisory board as well), robotics (as a TeraViks programmer), Girl Scouts (more on this later), and the band program. I am actually lead tenor in Jazz Band I in addition to playing in symphonic band (oboe), pep/marching band (tenor), and STOMP (percussion). After ten years of Girl Scouting and over 70 hours of work to earn my bronze and silver awards, I'm ready to start fundraising for international travel and earning my gold award, implying 80 hours more of dedicated work. Moreover, I plan on continuing rock climbing club when it restarts during second semester.</p>
                                <p>Of course, extracurriculars don't define me completely. Acedemically, I've set out to challenge myself in 2016 and 2017. I'm taking all honors/advanced core classes as well as AP World History, ALP Biology alongside Honors Chemistry (for 11th and 12th), online health (to accommodate the following), and another computer science independent study. Last year, my curriculum was over electronics: principle and application. This year, I'm ecstatic for an IS on data structures and algorithms.</p>
                                <p>Finally, just to preserve records for posterity, I would like to mention another interesting event I helped with: </p><a style="color: blue" href="http://m.cdapress.com/news/local_news/article_adc185ea-bea6-11e6-a40c-4b4ae4c9349b.html?mode=jqm">Hour of Code</a>
                                <p>Until next year,</p>

                                <p>Let it be known to the masses that Crista Falk compares to a record in two respects:</p>
                                <p><strong>1.) Despite her best efforts, she occasionally repeats the same thing over and over again, never to truly accomplish what she preaches.</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>2.) She gradually faded from the public eye, only to be revived after a considerable amount of time.</strong></p>
                                <p>That being said, I have decided earnestly not to lie to myself. I will only write ever so often after significant events or after months of Internet silence, whichever comes first. I'm a programmer, darnit, not an author. The deception ends now.</p>
                                <p>Regardless, I feel I owe an explanation. Since I have not one to give, I'll instead write a recapitulation of my summer thus far. I graduated from the 9th grade without much cause for event. Subsequently, I was fortunate enough to then go on another college tour, this time of WSU and the University of Idaho. Both were fun and educational. I won a tee shirt from the former school in a peculiar way. I answered that the college was founded in 1890 correctly, simply because I read it on a sign somewhere on campus an hour earlier. Later that day I arbitrarily, yet correctly, guessed the answer to another question. I say vaguely that it had to do with sports, and that my answer was the year 2003. I'm not confident that I knew in the moment what was being asked, but I'm thoroughly convinced of my own psychic abilities. Sometime after that, I attended a week long camp about java programming and cyber security principles. It was unsuprisingly amazing, beneficial, and totally information-packed. A great deal of coding was done in Processing, and at the end of the camp, I had made over half a dozen executable sketches, some event-based and interactive. This summer, because of faculty changes, I haven't been able to do nearly as much volunteering at the library. I'm excited still to help out again at this year's Coeur d' Con, a comic book and pop culture convention held at the Coeur d' Alene Library. Last year was full of fun, in spite of the 8 hour shift I willingly committed to. Speaking (or rather, writing) of literature, I've been able to get some great reading in. My summer book synopsis includes the Princess Bride, Mort, Pride and Prejudice, a collection of Hawthorne short stories, and several pages of Don Quixote, which I just started as of this morning. Thinking about it in retrospect, I seemed to have chosen a variety of each genre: fantasy, science fiction, historical fiction, short stories, and satire. Maybe it's just an attest to my indecision. Other than this, I've done some studying of classical music as well. For fun. I appreciate that Vivaldi wrote oh so many oboe concertos, and my favorite piece has to be his Four Seasons. However, as an overall composer, I admire Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Not only is his name one of the most fun to say out loud (PYO-tur ihl-YIHCH chy-KAWF-skee), but he's created some pretty influential stuff as well, I suppooose. Also, Bach jokes are far too mainstream. Much in the way that conclusions to written passages are overdone today in modern writing. I've never been one to conform.</p>
                                <p>Making nihilism a popular institution, just to be ironic,</p>

                                <h3>April 17th, 2016</h3>
                                <p>I have recently thought about my future in terms of college and career goals. I just attended an impressive trip around the Northwest and Seattle area, touring colleges with members of my highschool ETS group. I figure if I can span my anxiety and excitement about my future over the next four years, I will be able to divide it into more palatable segments over time. Logically, I should start considering my plans as soon as possible. That way I will be totally prepared. You know, because unforeseen circumstances never arise and priorities never ever change...</p>
                                <p>The dream job for me has always been to become a computer programmer or software engineer at a company that works to benefit the world around them. The work doesn't have to be immediately rewarding, and the company doesn't have to be an empire. My biggest hope is that my effort will be for a significant cause. I legitimately want to make the world a better place, as cliche as it may sound.</p>
                                <p> Biology and computer science are my two favorite branches of science, so where these two subjects converge, I want to be. With news of a novel programming language that can compile written code and upload it into living organisms allowing them to perform new functions, this is not such a far-fetched aspiration. <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/programming-language-living-cells-bacteria-0331">Thanks, MIT</a>. Computer science and molecular biology go together like peanut butter and jelly. Or peanut butter and chocolate. Or really just plain peanut butter. In this analogy, computer science is peanut butter. It comes in different variations and can be applied to any other branch to improve or change it. Maybe I should eat lunch before I write. At any rate, this is my present strategy, documented for my later self to look over and cringe, I'm sure.</p>
                                <p>Planning for the future, one sandwich metaphor at a time,</p>

                                <p>At this point, I have begun beating a dead horse with the "I swear I'll write more often" thing. Even when it is solely for my own sake and not for the sake of my GIGANTIC fan-base, I seem to be unable to follow through. </p>
                                <p>On a more positive note, STAR WARS... ahhh!</p>
                                <p>Ok. SO, I've started writing code using a bit of C++, and I made this interesting library of morse code in which functions representing letters or phrases could be called and sent to either of two ports that connect to two different colored lights on an Arduino board. The phrase functions were comprised of functions that were letters, which in turn were comprised of a combination of da and or dit functions. These base functions flashed a light for a duration of either 1 second or 500 milliseconds, in a sense that were either long or short, with delays between and afterward in order for the message to come across clearly. Essentially, the two lights were able to communicate and carry on a conversation, even if one were not adept in morse code. The entire project took nearly three hours, and at the end I was forced to erase all traces of it and exit  because I did not technically own the circuit board nor the computer I was typing on. I had my own sitting right across my room too. That's life, man. It's one big deleted program while an Arduino board mocks you for your lack of foresight. I suppose I'm just the Prometheus of writing code and trying buying Star Wars tickets. I forget until the latest possible second to think about what I should do.
</p>
                                <p>But STAR WARS... ahhhhHHHHHHH!
</p>
                                <p>Well, see you later Dark Side, my old friend,</p>

                                        <p>Nearly two months have passed since I've made any updates to this website, so my apologies to the handful of people who actually read it (you know who you are). Anyway, I have decided to add a new page, dedicated to games I make. As of now, I've only finished one fully-functional game, but I am already in the process of creating more. Some things with bowling balls. Some things with pizza ladders. Really great stuff, guys. It's my hope that they will grow more advanced with time and practice. Actually, now that I think about it, that's practically my life's motto at the moment as I discover different computery/engineery things alongside learning a new instrument (the oboe). In fact, I've learned one valuable lesson that applies to both: When you hear a blood curdling, high pitched beeping sound, you've done something wrong.</p>

                                        <p>School will begin in less than a week, so I've decided to spend the remainder of the summer being slightly more productive. That is, I should probably stop rewatching episodes of "Friends" at some point. After I deal with sitcom withdrawals, I plan to begin traversing the vast landscape that is creating a javascript based, 2 dimensional, side scrolling game. Even when phrased so excitingly, it's difficult to make it sound remotely interesting to anybody else but me. But trust me, this should be neat. It seems to be a given that with school starting I will have less time to spend doing fun computer sciency stuff. However, if I swap out the aforementioned laziness and procrastination for, well, pretty much anything else (a la Indiana Jones style), I should just about break even as far as free time goes. At least in an idyllic world that would be the situation. I have a feeling that I am going to join too many clubs and extracurriculars than warrented for a person with any shred of sanity, but I'm going to do it anyway. There's a kind of poetic contradiction in being so self-descructively constructive. And I love it.</p>

                                        <p>So, an entire month (fourteen days actually) has gone by since I last uploaded a post. I try to avoid the conclusion that I am extremely boring and instead supplement it with the fact that I am extremely busy. My family no longer pays for a Netflix account, which I think is the catalyst that will force me into a life of crime and super villainry. I have resorted to much less important activities like reading, learning the oboe, volunteering, taking cyber security classes, and rollerskating around town. How will I ever get into a ivy league university without "has watched every episode of <u>Friends</u> multiple times" and "can quote without error the lines of <u>Pulp Fiction</u>" on my transcript? I guess I'll just have to continue this 4.2 gpa streak (well placed brag which is a key part of my personality: that, and I find myself apologizing an obscene amount to others). Speaking of segways, I finally went back to Ubuntu (with my Chromebook as a host), and I plan on rekindling my relationship with Linux OS and command lines. That sentence depresses me slightly, but I swear someday my total lack of human connection will earn me millions of dollars. Or at least a really sweet robot butler. That distressing note seems to be a good place to stop and reevaluate my social skills.</p>
                                <p>Until the next time I wait 14 days to post anything,</p>
