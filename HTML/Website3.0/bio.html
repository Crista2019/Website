            <h1>MUSIC</h1>
            <p>I have been making music since the age of ten. Initially, I participated in my elementary school's orchestra program until I discovered my true passion lay in playing woodwinds. My instruents of choice today are the alto and tenor saxophone as well as the oboe and English Horn. I have participated in nearly every musical opportunity that my community has to offer: school programs such as concert band, symphonic band, STOMP percussion/perforance arts, pep band, marching band, advanced 0-hour jazz band, and the LCHS jazz combo, as well as external programs such as Coeur d'Alene Youth Orchestra, the 'Mataban Jazz Experience,' and the Perfection-Nots Marching Band. From Handel to Sousa to the Count Basie Big Band, music has always been and will continue to remain a significant influence on my life.</p>

          <h1>VOLUNTEERING</h1>
          <p>The public library has been a part of my life in one way or another since I was old enough to pick up a book. I have volunteered at the Coeur d'Alene library in an official capacity since the eighth grade. I am presently a member of the teen advisory board, essentially the 'Brain Trust' of library event hosting. I often help set up and supervise programs such as teen book clubs, creative writing clubs, crafting, Dungeons and Dragons <i>(yes, you read that correctly)</i>, as well as maintaining order in its public makerspace, teen room, and of course the copious rows upon rows of bookshelves.</p>

          <h1>PROMOTING STEM IN THE COMMUNITY</h1>
          <p>As a member of the LCHS Scholastic Team, a mentor for Gizmo-CDA's "Girls Who Code" club and other coding events, a software engineering intern at ExtraTech Systems, and a lifelong lover of all things math and science, I work to promote STEM wherever possible. Plus, I <i>absolutely</i> adore XKCD comics.</p>

          <h1>GIRLSCOUTS</h1>
          <p>Going on my 11th year of girlscouting as of 2017, I take pride in serving my community and the people who help to make it so wonderful. Beyond cookie sales and camping trips, Troop 3003 focuses primarily on volunteer work. The girls in my troop and I take the lead on many events that support CDA: Arbor Day tree planting, donation collection for World Relief, food drives, and more. As a part of earning my Bronze and Silver service project awards, I recall sewing hundreds of stuffed teddy bears to send to soldiers fighting over seas in Afghanistan and constructing a playground for the children of the Union Gospel Mission, respectively. I hope to continue this tradition of community service in completing my Gold Award as a senior Girlscout.</p>

          <h1>ROBOTICS</h1>
          <p>I discovered the TeraViks robotics team in my freshman year of highschool. I've had a passion for progamming for years, but competing on a FIRST Robotics team was my first opportunity to apply that skill. As a member of the programming team, of which there were two, I used the Python scripting language to control our robot in teleop as well as autonomous periods of competition. An acronym meaning  &quot;For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology,&quot; FRC continues to have a positive influence on my life and fuel my aspirations to one day work in the field of computer science and technology.</p>
